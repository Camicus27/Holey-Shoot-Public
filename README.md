# About this Repo
Hi! My name is Camron (Camicus27, CamicusGames) and I am just a solo indie developer who built this mobile game from the ground up over roughly 1000+ hours. I miss old mobile games that didn't force ads and often didn't even have purchases of any kind, so I aim to provide an entertaining arcade game that never takes you out of the fun and never forces you to do anything. No forced ads, no forced play style, the way you play is all up to you! There are of course some optional ad watches for some bonus in-game currencies, and the option to purchase additional in-game currencies, but you can play your way without ever spending a penny. All funds go directly towards helping me keep the lights on, so of course, every purchase and ad watch is extremely appreciated!

Feel free to leave a review and provide all the feedback you can so I can continue improving the game and fixing issues. I am just one person so any feedback is very valuable to me.

This repository serves as a publicly viewable version of my main version controlling branch. Though it is not frequently updated, development is still active, just slow as I have work and other responsibilities in between. Feel free to examine my code if you're interested in my code style, my process, and learning about my usage of many computer science principles, techiniques, and practices throughout.
